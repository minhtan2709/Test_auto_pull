00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,933
The first time my mom saw jackfruit hanging from a tree,

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:07,566
she was amazed, just like a three-year-old child.

3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:15,233
She didn’t touch a single vegetable in the pot.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,866
I tried to smooth things over, saying it was just her playful humor.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,600
But on the way home, my father said to me,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,700
This is the ending he traded for—

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,400
after giving me decades of his best years.

8
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,766
My father…...

9
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:46,833
has never lost his innocence and curiosity toward the world.

10
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,766
But because of me,

11
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:54,866
he put on the weight of another small home.

12
00:00:56,133 --> 00:01:03,500
How long has it been since you last hugged your father?

13
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,433
she thought the dipping sauce was tomato soup made by the waiter.

14
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,833
When we had hotpot,

15
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:18,633
She obediently finished the entire bowl of “sauce.”

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,666
“I must have embarrassed you.”

17
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,300
“I’m sorry.”
